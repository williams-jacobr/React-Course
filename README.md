A series of projects and tasks that build on one another to learn the core and more advanced concepts of ReactJS.

<b>Throughout this course, I make use of:</b>

- functional and class-based components (with a focus on functional components)
- hooks (useState, useReducer, useContext, useEffect, useRef, useCallback) and custom hooks
- Redux
- React router 5 and 6
- lazy loading
